#logging of container in k8s done by the ELK stack or elastic stack
ELK = ElasticSearch Logstash(or fluentd) Kibana
logstash= continuously geting the logs
elasticsearch manages the logs
kibana used for analysis the logs

installing the stack:
 you can find the stack in official kubernetes github repo in add-ons 
 for fluentd most of the config is store in: fluentd-es-configmap.yaml
 apply the files 

 points to note:
   service account is used to provide the proper access to stack 
   deamonsets is like the replicaset but we didn't need to specify the number of replica
   deamon set knows it needs to run on every single node
   elastic search using statefull set same as replicaset but name is not random
   its in sequence 0,1,2,3 mostly used when you need stable name of pods
   standard template not provide volume claim it store logs in temporary based
   needs to add volumeclaim template 
   kubectl get po -n kube-system
    kubectl get svc -n kube-system
