#In some cases we prefer the deployment over the replicasets.
#deployments have additional feature like rolling upgrade (by adding some yaml lines in replicaset)

# hirarchy:
# deployments have replicaset => replicaset have pods => pods are accessible by service

# when we start upgrading the deployments kubernetes will start deleting and creating the replicasets.
#and replicaset start deleting and updating pods

#when we update the image tag in the deployment
#On upgrade to new version a new replica set is created and in old version of RS replicas sets to be 0.
# so in case of any issue in upgrade we rollback to previous replicaset and increase the replicas.

#some rollout commands:
 kubectl rollout status deployment deployment-angularapp

$  kubectl rollout history deployment deployment-angularapp
deployment.apps/deployment-angularapp
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
2         <none>

$ kubectl rollout undo deployment deployment-angularapp --to-revision=2

$ kubectl rollout undo deployment deployment-angularapp --to-revision=1

#if we specify the wrong or bad docker image in deployment its not going to deploy and does not remove the
#old replica set because it will upgrade to new replica set only when all pods are healthy
#for this pod goes to a status known as ImagePullBackOff: it will wait some seconds to pull the image again
# and continue retring again and again
# so old replica set is working untill new one is created
# when we again specify the correct image the replica set will upgrade it self for new deployment.
