# For deleting a pod (--force = for forcefully delete)
kubectl delete po angularapp

#angularapp not comeback after delete
# so instead of deploying pods directly we deploy replicaset
# by specifying replica set we set that how many pods of the application we want to running at all time.
# for apiversion we have to specify the group and api version

#define pod in template

 kubectl describe rs replicaset-angularapp
 kubectl delete rs replicaset-angularapp

 #if you delete a replicaset it will also terminate the nodes of the replica set.
